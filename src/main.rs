// //memory management in rust
// Rust has its own ownership model for memory management
// Makes it extremely safe to memory errors
//that means....you can allocate and deallocate memory but there 
//are a set of rules we must follow while doing it
//without the need of garbage collectors

//It achieves this using the
// Mutability
// Heap and memory
// Ownership model
// Borrowing and references
// Lifetimes
